Associations of plasma omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids with overall and 19 site-specific cancers: a population-based cohort study in UK Biobank

## Background
Previous epidemiological studies of the associations between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cancer incidence have been inconsistent.


## Methods and Results
We investigated the associations of plasma omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs with the incidence of overall and 19 site-specific cancers in a large prospective cohort. 253,138 eligible UK Biobank participants were included in our study. With a mean follow-up of 12.9 years, 29,838 participants were diagnosed with cancer. The plasma levels of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs were expressed as percentages of total fatty acids (omega-3% and omega-6%). In our main models, both omega-6% and omega-3% were inversely associated with overall cancer incidence (HR per SD = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96-0.99; HR per SD = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.97-1.00; respectively). Of the 19 site-specific cancers available, 14 were associated with omega-6% and five with omega-3%, all indicating inverse associations, with the exception that prostate cancer was positively associated with omega-3% (HR per SD = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.05).



## Data
The UK Biobank study is a prospective, population-based cohort study in the United Kingdom. Between 2006 and 2010, 502,384 prospective participants, aged 40-69, in 22 assessment Centers throughout the UK were recruited for the study. The population information was collected through a self-completed touch-screen questionnaire; brief computer-assistant interview; physical and functional measures; and blood, urine, and saliva collection during the assessment visit.

The datasets analyzed during the current study are available from the UK Biobank through an application process (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).
